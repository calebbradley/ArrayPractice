ArrayPractice
=============

Short hands-on work with array/object literals.

 NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION!
 
 This was a learning experience with storing objects in arrays and some other simple features (i.e. form validation)
  The Design hurts I know! ;) But at the breakneck pace class was moving had not a spare second for design. I plan on re-visiting and cleaning it up!
